# Difference in ASTs generated by different compiler versions.
As we know a compiler first generates the AST when a source code is fed to it. But if we compile the source code with different versions 
of compilers, it will generate different ASTs. Here I am comparing the ASTs generated using OCaml 4.05.0 and OCaml 4.02.3

# Example 1:
Suppose the source code is:
```
[%multiplybyitself 2]
```
AST is generated using the code:
```
ocamlfind ppx_tools/dumpast -e "[%multiplybyitself 2]"
```

When using OCaml 4.05.0:

![multiplybyitself-AST-4.05](https://github.com/priyas13/ppx-ocaml/blob/master/multiplybyitself-AST-4.05.png)

When using OCaml 4.02.3:

![multiplybyitself-AST-4.02.3](https://github.com/priyas13/ppx-ocaml/blob/master/multiplybyitself-AST-4.02.3.png)

# Example 2
Suppose the source code is:
```
[%addone 1 + 2]
```
When using OCaml 4.05.0:

![addone-AST-4.05.0](https://github.com/priyas13/ppx-ocaml/blob/master/AST-addone.png)

When using OCaml 4.03.0:

![addone-AST-4.02.3](https://github.com/priyas13/ppx-ocaml/blob/master/addone-AST-4.02.3.png)

# Differences:
As we could see there are differences in the syntax of ASTs generated from both the versions. So if we try to run the PPX written 
for version 4.05.0 with the verison 4.03.0 and vice-versa, it won't work. 

I tried to break down the problem "Why mergeable type ppx is not working" by trying with these small examples. There is version problem
that I need to fix by looking at the syntax differences in the ASTs between both the versions.
